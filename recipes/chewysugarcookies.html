        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        This chewy sugar cookie recipe makes delicious cookies that are crisp on the outside and 
        very chewy on the inside. Just the way I like them! These cookies are meant to be shaped or 
        dropped. This recipe can easily be made into snickerdoodle cookies by rolling the dough in 
        cinnamon sugar before baking.
