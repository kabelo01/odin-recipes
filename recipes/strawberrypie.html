        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        This pie is my favorite and it's very easy to make. I got the recipe many years
        ago in North Jersey from the Sussex County Strawberry Farm.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>

                Gradually stir cornstarch mixture into boiling strawberry mixture.
                Reduce heat and simmer mixture until thickened for about 10 minutes whilst stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Pour cooked strawberry mixture over berries in pastry shell. 
                Refrigerate until chilled and set for at least 3 hours.</li>
